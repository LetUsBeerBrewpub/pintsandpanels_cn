# I is for Irish Moss

> Not really "moss" -- Irish Moss is a seaweed added to boil kettle that grows abundantly in Europe and North America

并非真正的“苔藓”——它是一种海藻，在欧洲和北美大量生长，可以用来添加到煮沸锅中的

> Irish Moss has "carrageenan" in it, which attracts proteins and make them clump to clear haze in beer

爱尔兰海藻中含有“卡拉胶”，能使麦汁中的蛋白质凝结达到清澈啤酒的目的

> Can be used in real ale production as an auxiliary fining although not added directly to the cask itself

爱尔兰海藻可以使用在真艾尔的酿造工艺中，但不会直接添加到酒桶中
