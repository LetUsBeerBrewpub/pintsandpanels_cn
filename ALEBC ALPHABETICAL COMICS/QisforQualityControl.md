品控是酿造过程中的重要步骤

> Making sure beer is the right ABV, lacks off-flavors, won't gush/become infected in the future and is what the brewer intended

酿酒师需要确保出品的啤酒有正确的酒精度数，没有异味，不会染菌

> Brewers in small breweries do QA/QC themselves while larger breweries have in house labs and cientists on staff

小型啤酒厂由酿酒师们自己进行品控管理，而大型啤酒厂则拥有内部实验室和相关科学家
